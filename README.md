<img src='https://github.com/tekofu/Mailbot/raw/master/Assets/Circle-Icon.png'>

A bad Discord bot written in Python

Some features it has includes:
- Echo text back with string manipulation
- Play Rock paper scissors with the bot
- Search for YouTube videos
- Magic 8-Ball responses
- Random bonequest comics
- Self pinning to a dedicated channel
- Image mirroring

TODO:
- Use URLs for image manip as well as content
- Better documentation for setup and use
- Random septapus comic posting
- Fix cry functionality from [original source](https://github.com/dead-bird/apcry/blob/master/api/cry.js) - just needs the math tweaking and adding swapping characters
- More dumb joke features
- Implement logging (only if needed)
