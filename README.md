# Mailbot
A discord bot written in python with the following features:
- OwO-ify messages
- [Cry-ify](https://apcry.deadbird.dev/) messages
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the bot
- Search for YouTube videos

TODO:
- Image manipulation
- Better documentation for setup and use
- Allow for combination of string manipulation commands (and remove ".crowo")
- Port cry functionality from [original source](https://github.com/dead-bird/apcry/blob/master/api/cry.js) as it is now down
