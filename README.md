A discord bot written in python with the following features:
- OwO-ify messages
- Cry-ify messages
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the bot
- Search for YouTube videos
- Magic 8-Ball responses
- Random bonequest comics
- Self pinning to a dedicated channel

TODO:
- Image manipulation
- Better documentation for setup and use
- Random septapus comic posting
- Allow for combination of string manipulation commands (and remove ".crowo")
- Fix cry functionality from [original source](https://github.com/dead-bird/apcry/blob/master/api/cry.js) - just needs the math tweaking and adding swapping characters
- More dumb joke features
- Implement logging (only if needed)
